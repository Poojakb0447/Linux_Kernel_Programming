Assignment 4 

Homework 4 on Memory: Paging
1. Paging - show_mem: To help you understand the buddy system, you will do two small experiments with the kernel source code. 
First, insert show_mem() somewhere in your kernel so that you will get all the info show_mem() provides. Remember to put your name before each printk.
Note that show_mem calls show_free_areas which will in turn call show_node. You will have to go down a few levels to insert your name before each printk.

2. Paging - /proc/buddyinfo: Second, implement your own kernel function that prints /proc/buddyinfo.

Like previous HWs, recompile the kernel and load the latest version.
The new kernel version will print the information in dmesg (/var/log/messages) along with other standard messages. 
Make sure to submit a tgz file of /var/log/messages or screen shots showing appropriate /proc files and the portion of your code you included/modified.
